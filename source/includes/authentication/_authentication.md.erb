# Authentication

Each request to the Rundl API must be authenticated. Rundl uses OAuth to provide authorised access to resources via its API. OAuth has a number of benefits:

- Users are not required to share their passwords with third party applications.
- Standard libraries available in most application frameworks.

When you register your application we assign it OAuth credentials and send them to you. Contact [support@rundl.com](mailto:support@rundl.com?subject=Register API client) to register for API access. Registration is currently a manual process.
