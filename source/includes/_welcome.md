# Welcome

Welcome to the Rundl API! 

With the Rundl API you can connect with the ecosystem of people, companies, services and data around you business. Create a collaborative community of your teams, customers and partners and bridge the traditional boundaries that constrain how you do business. Find out more about process collaboration done the Rundl way [here](https://rundl.com).

At Rundl we build our client apps on the same public API that we document here. That means we're committed to ongoing development, making it feature rich, clean and consistent. We welcome you to leverage the Rundl API in your applications too. Please get in touch via [support@rundl.com](mailto:support@rundl.com) if you have questions or need help.

The Rundl API is currently in Beta. Product features are being added regularly. Also, patterns and techniques used in our API have evolved over a number of years, but are not yet evenly rolled out across all endpoints. We're working as fast as we can to complete a stable version.
