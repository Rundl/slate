# Welcome

Welcome to the **Rundl API** reference. 

With the Rundl API you can connect your applications with the network of people, companies, services and data around you business processes. Create a collaborative community of your teams, customers and partners to bridge boundaries that constrain business processes. Find out more about process collaboration done the Rundl way [here](https://rundl.com).

At Rundl we build our client apps on the same public API that we document here. That means we're committed to its ongoing development, making it feature rich, clean and consistent. We welcome you to leverage the Rundl API in your applications too. Please get in touch via [support@rundl.com](mailto:support@rundl.com) if you need help or have questions about how to get started.

<aside class="notice">
The Rundl API is currently in beta. We add product features regularly. Also, patterns and techniques used in our API have evolved over a number of years, but are not yet evenly rolled out across all endpoints. We're working as fast as we can to complete a stable version.
