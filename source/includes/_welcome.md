# Welcome

Welcome to the Rundl API! 

With the Rundl API you can connect with the ecosystem of people, companies, services and data around you business. Create a collaborative community of your teams, customers and partners and bridge the traditional boundaries that constrain how you do business. Find out more about our unique process collaboration model [here](https://rundl.com).

At Rundl we build our client apps on the same public API that we document here. That means we're committed to improving this API and making it feature rich, clean and consistent. 

**The Rundl API is currently in Beta**. That means our API is a work in progress. While strong patterns have evolved, and improved techniques developed, over a number of years, these patterns and techniques are not evenly rolled out across all endpoints. In addition, product features are being added regularly.  We're working as fast as we can to complete a stable version. 

So we hope you'll get onboard, and leverage the Rundl API to make your business processes open and collaborative. Please get in touch via support@rundl.com if you have questions or need help.
